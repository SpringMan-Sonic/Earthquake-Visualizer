Notes:
- The USGS feed URL in the project gives the data of earthquakes magnitude.
  This app uses the  URL: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson
- This component focuses on core functionality: fetching recent quakes, plotting them on an interactive Leaflet map,
  showing popups, a magnitude filter, responsive layout, and graceful error handling.
